        "# Introduction\n",
        "Agentic workflows represent a paradigm shift in how we interact with generative AI models. Instead of simply prompting a model for a single output, agentic workflows empower the model to autonomously perform a series of actions, make decisions, and achieve a defined goal. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of agentic workflows, their benefits, challenges, and implementation strategies.\n",

        "## Core Components of an Agentic Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Goal Definition:**  \n",
        "   Clearly articulate the desired outcome or objective. This forms the foundation for all subsequent actions. Examples include: \"Write a blog post about the latest advancements in AI,\" \"Generate a marketing campaign for a new product,\" or \"Create a comprehensive financial report.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Action Planning:**  \n",
        "   Decompose the goal into smaller, manageable actions. This might involve brainstorming, outlining, researching, writing, and editing. The AI agent needs a plan to proceed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Action Execution:**  \n",
        "   Utilize generative AI models and other tools to execute each planned action. This might involve invoking large language models (LLMs) for text generation, image generation models for visual content, or APIs for data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Decision Making:**  \n",
        "   The agent must decide which action to take next, often based on the results of previous actions. This can involve evaluating intermediate outputs, incorporating feedback, or adapting to unexpected situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Monitoring and Evaluation:**  \n",
        "   Continuously monitor the progress and evaluate the quality of the generated content. This allows for corrective actions or adjustments to the workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Feedback Loop:**  \n",
        "   Incorporate feedback mechanisms to refine the agent's behavior and improve performance over time. This might involve human feedback or automated evaluation metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implementation Strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Rule-Based Systems:**  \n",
        "  Define a strict set of rules that dictate the agent's behavior. While simple to implement, they lack flexibility and struggle with complex or unpredictable scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reinforcement Learning:**  \n",
        "  Train an AI agent to optimize its actions based on rewards and penalties. This approach can lead to more adaptive and efficient workflows, but requires significant training data and computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hybrid Approaches:**  \n",
        "  Combine rule-based systems with reinforcement learning or other machine learning techniques to leverage the strengths of both methods. This allows for greater flexibility while still providing some level of control.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tools and Technologies\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Large Language Models (LLMs):**  \n",
        "  Form the core of many agentic workflows, capable of generating text, summarizing information, translating languages, and answering questions. Examples include GPT-3, GPT-4, PaLM 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Prompt Engineering:**  \n",
        "  Crafting effective prompts is crucial for guiding the AI agent's actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Workflow Automation Platforms:**  \n",
        "  Tools like LangChain or LlamaIndex can streamline the implementation of complex workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Datastores:**  \n",
        "  Efficiently store and retrieve information needed during the workflow execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits of Agentic Workflows\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Automation:**  \n",
        "  Automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Efficiency:**  \n",
        "  Optimize workflows for faster and more effective content creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scalability:**  \n",
        "  Easily scale workflows to handle large volumes of requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Adaptability:**  \n",
        "  Adapt workflows to changing circumstances and user feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Challenges of Agentic Workflows\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Complexity:**  \n",
        "  Designing and implementing complex agentic workflows can be challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Control:**  \n",
        "  Maintaining control over the agent's behavior is crucial to ensure desired outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Bias and Fairness:**  \n",
        "  Generative AI models can perpetuate biases present in their training data, affecting the fairness of outputs.\n"

        "#What is an Agent?\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of generative AI, an agent is an autonomous entity capable of performing a series of actions to achieve a defined goal. Unlike traditional AI models that generate a single output based on a given prompt, agents operate within an environment and interact with it to accomplish their objectives.  Think of them as automated workflows with decision-making capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Types of Agents\n",
        "\n",
        "Agents can be categorized based on their architecture, learning methods, and functionalities:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Rule-Based Agents:** These agents operate based on a predefined set of rules.  They are deterministic and follow a strict sequence of actions. They are simple to implement but inflexible and struggle with unforeseen circumstances.  They are good for scenarios where the environment and goals are well-defined and predictable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reinforcement Learning Agents:** These agents learn to make decisions through trial-and-error interactions with the environment. They are rewarded for taking actions that lead to desired outcomes and penalized for undesirable actions.  They are highly adaptable but require extensive training and computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Hybrid Agents:** Combining rule-based systems with reinforcement learning or other machine learning techniques creates hybrid agents. They leverage the strengths of both approaches to achieve greater flexibility while maintaining some level of control.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Retrieval-Augmented Agents:** These agents leverage external knowledge sources like databases or document stores.  They can access and process information to inform their actions and decisions.  This boosts their capabilities beyond their own internal knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Planning Agents:** These agents perform an initial planning phase before executing actions.  They consider possible future outcomes and select an optimal sequence of actions to achieve the goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#Popular Open-Source and Custom Agents\n",
        "\n",
        "* **LangChain:** A powerful framework for developing applications powered by language models. Provides components for building agents, including tools for interacting with external APIs, databases, and other services.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **LlamaIndex:** Another excellent framework offering similar functionality to LangChain. Focuses on building agents that can retrieve and process information effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Auto-GPT:** A popular example of a fully autonomous AI agent that can perform a wide range of tasks. It's built on top of GPT and uses a recursive approach to break down complex problems into smaller ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Custom Agents:**  Numerous custom agents are developed based on specific needs. The choice of tools (LangChain, LlamaIndex, or other libraries) and techniques (rule-based, reinforcement learning, etc.) will determine the kind of custom agents created.  These custom agents are crucial for highly specific tasks where off-the-shelf agents don't suit the needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** The field of agentic workflows is evolving rapidly. New architectures, frameworks, and techniques are constantly emerging."

        "\n",
        "### What are Guardrails?\n",
        "\n",
        "Guardrails are mechanisms or frameworks designed to ensure that generative AI systems behave in a safe, ethical, and predictable manner. They act as a set of constraints or rules that guide the model’s output and interaction within acceptable and defined boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "These constraints can range from limiting inappropriate content generation to ensuring the outputs align with domain-specific requirements. Guardrails can be implemented at various levels, such as during data preprocessing, model training, or in the post-processing of generated outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Are Guardrails Useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Ensuring Ethical Compliance**  \n",
        "Generative AI models often generate unpredictable results. Guardrails help prevent outputs that could be offensive, biased, or harmful, thus ensuring adherence to ethical standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Improving Reliability**  \n",
        "By guiding the model’s behavior, guardrails enhance the consistency and dependability of outputs, which is especially important for applications in sensitive domains like healthcare or legal advisory.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Domain-Specific Alignment**  \n",
        "Guardrails enable models to focus on generating outputs relevant to specific industries or contexts, reducing irrelevant or out-of-scope content.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Reducing Risk of Misuse**  \n",
        "Guardrails act as a safety mechanism against potential misuse of generative AI by enforcing boundaries, such as preventing the generation of malicious code or misinformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Facilitating Compliance with Regulations**  \n",
        "In regulated industries, guardrails help ensure the AI system adheres to legal and policy requirements, such as GDPR or HIPAA compliance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Guardrails are critical for creating safe, ethical, and reliable generative AI applications. They empower developers to harness the potential of generative AI models like `llama-guard-3-8b` while minimizing risks and aligning outputs with user expectations and organizational goals.\n",

        "# Ways to Use Guardrails in Generative AI Applications\n",
        "\n",
        "Guardrails can be implemented through various strategies and tools, each catering to different stages of the AI development lifecycle. Below are the most common approaches to employing guardrails:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Rule-Based Filtering**\n",
        "   - Employ explicit rules to filter or constrain outputs.\n",
        "   - Rules can be written using regex, logic scripts, or simple content-checking algorithms.\n",
        "   - Ideal for detecting keywords, formatting violations, or other explicit patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Post-Processing Filters**\n",
        "   - Process the output generated by the model to remove undesirable or unsafe content.\n",
        "   - Tools like `spaCy`, `NLTK`, or other text-processing libraries can sanitize or reformat responses.\n",
        "   - Examples include profanity removal, sentiment analysis, and toxicity filtering.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Systems**\n",
        "   - Integrate manual reviews at critical stages, where human experts validate model outputs.\n",
        "   - Useful in high-stakes domains like healthcare or law, where absolute reliability is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Domain-Specific Constraints**\n",
        "   - Incorporate domain knowledge to ensure the model adheres to specific requirements.\n",
        "   - For example, use schema validation to ensure generated responses align with structured data like JSON or XML.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Dynamic Reinforcement through Feedback Loops**\n",
        "   - Deploy feedback systems that learn from flagged or problematic responses, improving guardrails over time.\n",
        "   - Implement using model fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or reinforcement learning.\n",
