[Installation Steps](#installation-steps)\n3. [Description of Folder Structure](#description-of-folder-structure)\n4. [How to Run the Sample Test](#how-to-run-the-sample-test)\n5. [Troubleshooting Guide](#troubleshooting-guide)\n\n## 1. Pre-requisites\n\nBefore you can get started with Playwright and TypeScript, you'll need to ensure your Mac OS Sequoia environment meets the following pre-requisites:\n\n- **macOS Sequoia**: Ensure your system is running the latest version of macOS Sequoia.\n- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed. You can download it from https://nodejs.org. Use npm (Node Package Manager) to handle packages.\n- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed and configured. You can check this by opening Terminal and running `git --version`.\n- **Terminal**: Access to Terminal (found in Applications > Utilities > Terminal) to execute all commands.\n\n## 2. Installation Steps\n\n### 2.1. Clone the Repository (Optional)\n\nIf you have a specific repository with your Playwright and TypeScript project, clone it using:\n\n```bash\ngit clone <repository-url>\ncd <repository-name>\n```\n\n### 2.2. Initialize a New Project\n\nIf you are starting a new project, you can do so by initializing a new Node.js project.\n\n```bash\nmkdir my-playwright-project\ncd my-playwright-project\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis will create a new directory and initialize a `package.json` file.\n\n### 2.3. Install Playwright and TypeScript\n\nInstall Playwright and TypeScript by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm install playwright @types/node typescript ts-node --save-dev\n```\n\n### 2.4. Set Up TypeScript Configuration\n\nRun `npx tsc --init` to create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project. Edit the file to suit your project needs. A minimal configuration might look something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"ES2020\",\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2.5. Install Playwright Browsers\n\nInstall the browser binaries that Playwright will use.\n\n```bash\nnpx playwright install\n```\n\n## 3. Description of Folder Structure\n\nOnce the setup is complete, your folder structure might look like this:\n\n```\nmy-playwright-project/\n├── node_modules/\n├── tests/\n│   └── example.spec.ts\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── package.json\n├── package-lock.json\n└── playwright.config.ts\n```\n\n- **node_modules/**: Contains all the installed Node.js packages.\n- **tests/**: Directory containing your test files.\n- **tsconfig.json**: Configuration file for TypeScript.\n- **package.json**: Configuration file for Node.js project dependencies.\n- **package-lock.json**: Lock file for Node.js project dependencies.\n- **playwright.config.ts**: Configuration file for Playwright.\n\n## 4. How to Run the Sample Test\n\nTo run a sample test, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a Test File**:\n   Create a test file in the `tests` directory, for example `example.spec.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest('page title', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n  await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Example Domain');\n});\n```\n\n2. **Run the Test**:\n   Execute the test using the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```bash\nRunning 1 test using 1 worker\n\n  ✓ 1 passed (0.1s)\n```\n\n## 5. Troubleshooting Guide\n\n### 5.1. Node.js Issues\n\n- **Module not found**: Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed correctly. Try reinstalling Node.js.\n- **Versions conflict**: Use `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to manage multiple Node.js versions.\n\n### 5.2. Playwright Issues\n\n- **Browser binaries not found**: Use `npx playwright install` to install the necessary browser binaries.\n- **Browser launch failure**: Ensure no other process is using the same port. Check for any running browser instances and close them.\n\n### 5.3. TypeScript Compilation Errors\n\n- **TypeScript compile errors**: Ensure your `tsconfig.json` is correctly configured. Check the TypeScript compiler output for detailed error messages.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set up and run Playwright tests with TypeScript on your Mac OS Sequoia machine.\n```\n\nThe document is now revised and improved for completeness, relevance, and correctness.
