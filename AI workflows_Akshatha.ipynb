You can check this by running `node -v` in the terminal.\n- If not installed, visit [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest LTS version.\n\n### 1.2 Install Homebrew (Package Manager)\n- Open Terminal and run the following command:\n  ```bash\n  /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n  ```\n- Verify the installation with:\n  ```bash\n  brew --version\n  ```\n\n### 1.3 Install Xcode Command Line Tools\n- Run the following command in Terminal:\n  ```bash\n  xcode-select --install\n  ```\n\n## 2. Installation Steps\n\n### 2.1 Initialize a new Node.js project\n- In your project directory, run:\n  ```bash\n  npm init -y\n  ```\n\n### 2.2 Install Playwright and TypeScript\n- Run the following commands in the terminal:\n  ```bash\n  npm install playwright\n  npm install typescript --save-dev\n  npm install @types/node --save-dev\n  npm install ts-node --save-dev\n  npx playwright install\n  ```\n\n### 2.3 Initialize TypeScript Configuration\n- Run:\n  ```bash\n  npx tsc --init\n  ```\n\n## 3. Description of Folder Structure\n\n### 3.1 Typical Folder Structure\n```\nproject-root/\n│\n├── node_modules/\n├── tests/\n│   └── example.spec.ts\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── package.json\n├── playwright.config.ts\n└── README.md\n```\n\n- `node_modules/`: Contains installed Node.js packages.\n- `tests/`: Directory for your test files.\n- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.\n- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.\n- `playwright.config.ts`: Playwright configuration file.\n- `README.md`: Project documentation.\n\n## 4. How to Run the Sample Test\n\n### 4.1 Writing a Sample Test\n- Create a file named `example.spec.ts` in the `tests/` directory with the following content:\n  ```typescript\n  import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\n  test('basic test example', async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('https://example.com');\n    await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Example Domain');\n  });\n  ```\n\n### 4.2 Running the Test\n- Run the test using the following command:\n  ```bash\n  npx playwright test\n  ```\n- Expected output in the terminal:\n  ```bash\n  Running 1 test using 1 worker\n  1 test passed (1 passed) (0.1s)\n  ```\n\n## 5. Troubleshooting Guide\n\n### 5.1 Common Issues\n- **Issue**: Playwright browser installations failing.\n  - **Solution**: Run `npx playwright install` to re-install browsers.\n\n- **Issue**: TypeScript compilation errors.\n  - **Solution**: Ensure `tsconfig.json` is correctly configured. Common issues include missing `\"types\"` and `\"include\"` fields.\n\n- **Issue**: Tests failing due to missing dependencies.\n  - **Solution**: Ensure `package.json` includes all necessary dependencies and run `npm install`.\n\n- **Issue**: Incorrect Node.js version.\n  - **Solution**: Verify the Node.js version with `node -v` and ensure it matches the recommended version for the project.\n\n---\n\nThis guide provides a comprehensive step-by-step method for setting up Playwright and TypeScript on Mac OS Sequoia, including detailed instructions and expected outputs at each step. Following these steps ensures that users can successfully install, configure, and run tests using Playwright and TypeScript.\n```"
